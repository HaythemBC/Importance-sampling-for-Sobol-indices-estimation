# Importance-sampling-for-Sobol-indices-estimation 

This repository contains the **single Python notebook** used to reproduce the numerical results of the paper:

**“Importance sampling for Sobol' indices estimation”**
*Haythem Boucharif , Jérôme Morio and Paul Rochet - 2025*

The notebook implements section 4.1 and 4.2 of the paper

Everything is intentionally kept in **one self-contained notebook (.ipynb)** to make reproduction straightforward.  
No external modules, no hidden dependencies — just run the notebook from top to bottom.

**Dependencies:** NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

Feel free to reuse or adapt the code for your own sensitivity analysis experiments.
